## Context

LDS is supposed to remove code, specifically Apex.
When used for read and write, it requires a lot of client code, removing the advantage.

Not supported in Lightning Out!

Seems well suited for read only i.e. not much code to write. Not suitable for write.

lightning:recordEditForm is much better if doing a record CRUD form.

## Decision

Stop using LDS.
